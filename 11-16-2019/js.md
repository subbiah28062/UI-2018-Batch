mutable: can be edited
immutable: cannot be edited

var: 
  function scoped
  undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

let: 
  block scoped
  ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared

const:
  block scoped
  ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
  can't be reassigned


Object:
    to make object immutable:
        const obj = {
        prop: 42
        };

        Object.freeze(obj);

components:
    Components are self-sustaining, independent micro-entities that describe a part of your UI. An application's UI can be split up into smaller components where each component has its own code, structure, and API.

function arguments: (infinte arguments)
    in regular functions we can use arguments variable 
        ex: function a() {return arguments}
            console.log(a('HI')) //['HI']
    In arrow function argument variable does not exist so use spread operation:
        ex: const a = (...arg) => {return arg}
            console.log(a('HI')) //['HI']
            
first-class functions:
    meaning that functions are treated like any other first-class object â€” they can be stored in variables, passed around, returned from other functions, and even hold their own properties.
